Given the availability of various alternatives across the industry customer has a propensity to move to another financial institution for Balance Transfer. Foreclosure and balance transfer has added to the concerns of NBFCs. Foreclosure means repaying the outstanding loan amount in a single payment instead of with EMIs while balance transfer is transferring outstanding Loan availed from one Bank / Financial Institution to another Bank / Financial Institution, usually on the grounds of better service, top-up on the existing loan, proximity of branch, saving on interest repayments, etc. Losing out on customers on grounds on foreclosure and balance transfer leads to revenue loss. Acquiring a new customer can cost up to five times more than retaining an existing customer and an increase in customer retention by 5% increases profits up to 25%.

NBFCs have started taking pro-active measures to ensure this is curbed; and this is where you come in! Objective is primarily to arrive at a propensity to foreclose and balance transfer an existing loan based on lead indicators such as demographics, internal behavior and performance on all credit lines; along with the estimated ‘Time to Foreclose’.
